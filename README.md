# 🚗 Uber Auto Analytics Dashboard | Power BI
A comprehensive **Power BI project** designed to analyze and visualize Uber Auto ride data — transforming raw booking information into meaningful business insights.  
This dashboard demonstrates strong **data cleaning, modeling, and visualization skills** to uncover trends in booking performance, revenue, and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To analyze Uber Auto ride data and identify key patterns related to:

- Revenue distribution by vehicle type  
- Monthly trends in bookings and ride value  
- Customer satisfaction and performance hotspots

## 💡 Problems Addressed & Solutions

| Problem | Approach & Solution |
| **1. Lack of clarity on completed vs cancelled rides** | Created clear donut visuals showing percentages of completed, cancelled, and incomplete bookings for quick comparison. |
| **2. Difficulty tracking monthly performance trends** | Used a dynamic line chart to visualize “Completed Bookings by Month,” helping identify low-performing months (e.g., February). |
| **3. Unclear revenue contribution from different vehicle types** | Built a bar chart showing “Revenue by Vehicle Type,” revealing that **Auto** dominates earnings while **Uber XL** and **eBike** lag behind. |
| **4. Need to evaluate customer satisfaction patterns** | Integrated average rating KPIs (4.43★) to track service quality across periods. 
| **5. No visibility on top-performing locations** | Added a map card highlighting **Ashram** as the area with maximum completed bookings. 
| **6. Revenue distribution inconsistency** | Added monthly booking value visualization to check for seasonality and ensure steady income flow.
